        <h4>SKINS: 2-4 Players</h4>
        <p>
            Concept: Each hole has an initial value of 1 "skin". The money value per skin is input at the beginning of the game. A player will win the skin(s) for that hole if the player wins the hole outright with a score of par or better(birdie, eagle, double eagle). 
            If the lowest score for the hole is a tie or no player scores a par or better on that hole, then the skin(s) for that hole are carried over to the next hole. If the last of the round is a tie, then any carried over skins and the skin for that hole are a wash.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a player wins a hole outright with a score of par or better they are awarded the skin(s) for that hole. 
            If the player wins the hole with a birdie, then the value of skins awarded for that hole is doubled. 
            If the player wins the hole with a eagle, then the value of skins awarded for that hole is tripled.
            If the player wins the hole with a double eagle, then the value of skins awarded for that hole is quadrupled.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the round, all players total skins are counted. The player with the most skins is the winner of the game. 
            Each player owes the winner the difference of their total skins won. 
            EXAMPLE: If PLAYER A has a total of 25 skins and PLAYER B has a total of 20 skins, then PLAYER B owes PLAYER A 5 skins.

        <h4>NASAU: 2-4 Players</h4>
        <p>
            Concept: Money is wagered on the best score in the front nine (holes 1–9), back nine (holes 10–18), and total 18 holes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is no outright winner for any 9 holes, then that bet is carried over and added to the value of the subsequent 9 holes. If there is no outright winner for any 9 holes or total combined score, the bet is wash. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Optionally total putts for each 9 holes and overall may be counted as well. The value of those bets is equal to the value set on the wager for strokes.

        <h4>ROUND RONIN: 4 Players - Coming Soon!</h4>
        @*<p>
            Concept: Players will rotate teams every third of a round(3 holes for 9, 6 for 18). This ensures each player has played with each other player as a teammate.

            Example: Players A,B,C,D - 18 hole round
            Holes 1-6 are team (A,B) vs (C,D)
            Holes 7-12 are team (A,C) vs (B,D)
            Holes 13-18 are team (A,D) vs (B,C)
